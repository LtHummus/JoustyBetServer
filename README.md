# JoustyBetServer

This project is the web backend for a betting system on Johann Sebatian Joust games. The site on its own does nothing; it requires modifications to the actual game as well (which I have not released). 

This project is designed for playing the game at large conventions (such as PAX), where a large crowd gathers to watch. The idea behind JoustyBet is that spectators can use the web browsers on their smart phones to visit a website and bet before each round on who they think the round's victor will be (NOTE: though I use the term 'bet' no actual money changes hands). 

The site is built on Python + Flask and uses Socket.IO for asynchronous communication.
